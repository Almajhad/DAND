### Wrangle and Analyze Data (from Twitter)

In this project, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called Data Wrangling. I documented my wrangling efforts in this Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and its libraries.

The WeRateDogs dataset that I  wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
